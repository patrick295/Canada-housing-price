In this project, we used the Canada housing dataset to show:

How many people own land and houses in some parts of Canada
How many Africans move to Canada and own property
The dates and years in which houses were bought most frequently
Average house prices by province in Canada
Cost of living
Cost of living vs. average income by province
Average income in Canada by province, 1981-2023
Percentage change in average house price in Canadian provinces, 2015-2022
Number of foreigners from Africa that own land or houses in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, and Alberta
We used the following Python libraries to visualize the data:

matplotlib
pandas
numpy
seaborn
This repository will be updated regularly with new codes and insights.

Feel free to play around with the codes and give feedback!
